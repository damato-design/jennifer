**Amor is a design system designed to deliver consistent and accessible e-commerce experiences at scale across multiple Signet brands.**


## The Situation

I joined the team after an agency handed off the initial design system. The original system included foundational elements: colors, typography, spacing, a small set of custom icons, buttons, and some form elements. 

## My Role

In my role, I focused on **refining the visual language of the design system, creating reusable components in Figma, and collaborating with developers** to implement them in Hybris, a cloud-based e-commerce platform. This also involved designing icons, comprehensive documentation, and outreach.


## The Problems *(we will only address a few)*

Our task was to expand the system while the product designers were simultaneously redesigning the digital products. This led to some overlap and friction in the early stages but was resolved as the design system expanded.

The agency handoff had elements that did not meet WCAG standards and so we had to revisit color, typography scales, as well and expand on their form fields as we were building out the system.

##Documentation
We started on Invisions DSM (RIP), since it was a good place to get the system up and running quickly. As we moved into zeroheight for documentation, which visually was more appealing, but we ran across other issues. 

As we researched and built out componenents, we also worked on documention for them. This was a place for designers to understand design and content guidelines as well as see the component in action in Storybook. 


How do you frame the problem in a way so it's like a "Me too"– I have that problem too!

Things I did
- Update colors – Hicks law for designers (too many choices), and too many of the colors were not accessible. I updated the neutral tones, and removed one and also updated and expanded the supporting colors to meet the needs of our designers. 
- Created components based off shared needs from different product 
  - I audited the new designs being designed while we were working on the system and found some low-hanging fruits. One of them was
     - Accordion: There were different accordions on the same page, let lone other experiences. It's a lot of information that we didn't necessarily want the user to scroll through, but the business wanted to have on the page. 

Inventory / Inconsistencies

DSM > zeroheight
- DSM was great to start off a design system because it was quick to start and was build to have storybook and create tokens all in one place. One of biggest issues that rose as we continued working in DSM was that the formatting was very limited. I struggled a lot working within it's limitations as we were building it out. 
- When we were demoing different documentation platforms, there were two we landed between: zeroheight & Knapsack. I had wanted to move forward with Knapsack because they felt more customizable and willing to work with you. Zeroheight felt more like the tried and tested solution, and while there were better features than DSM, I felt that they had some set ways and wasn't necessarily going to answer all our issues. 

It felt like Sketch vs Figma (back in 2022), where zeroheight was tried and tested and Knapsack was the new kid on the block and was listening more closely to the feedback of their users. 

Even though I voiced my opinions, leadership decided to move forward with zeroheight since they were more established, and while they are receptive to our feedback, there are still many issues with connectivity we are dealing with now. 

The problem semantic tokens are solving is the problem of changing expressions of the brand. People have a need for expression and semantic tokens is the mechanism in which we can provide these expressions without changing everything. We are just 'painting' this. Brands want to express themselves in different ways.
