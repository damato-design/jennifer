## Context & Background

Signet Jewelers’ e-commerce experience lacked a strategic, user-friendly way to surface promotions and offers. Users encountered fragmented, repetitive offers that doesn’t feel relevant or timely. As a result, **engagement with promotions was low, and customer feedback noted confusion and frustration**.

## Problem

The brand sites lack a cohesive and strategic approach to displaying promotions and offers, resulting in a fragmented experience for users. Offers were often repeated, generic, and lacked personalization or contextual relevance. 

Customers weren’t seeing the right deals at the right time, and there was no clear way to revisit some previously seen offers. This led to user frustration and missed engagement opportunities.

## Goals

- Centralizes all types of offers (discount and non-discount)
- Integrates seamlessly into the shopping journey (except at checkout).
- Makes promotions easy to discover, understand, and return to.
- Supports both business conversion and customer satisfaction.

I led the design for a single, consistent destination for site-wide promotions. It addressed the need for user visibility and control over their promotions.

#### Types of offers offered:
- Discount Offers – Price reductions (e.g., "25% off gold necklaces")
- Non-Discount Offers – Value-added benefits (e.g., loyalty rewards, free shipping)

### Discovery & Insights

To understand the landscape and define the problem, steps taken:
- Competitive audit
- Work with a researcher to test out different comparative experiences
- Tested 4 different variations of the offer experience
- Tested 2 updated versions

### Key Takeaways

From the first two rounds of testing, several key themes emerged:
- **Users seek simplicity in evaluating value:** They don’t want to work hard to figure out which promotion offers the best deal.
- **Too many options = decision fatigue:** An overload of nuanced offers made it harder for users to choose confidently.
- **Perceived abundance builds trust:** Having a broad range of offers makes users feel they’ll get a deal no matter what they buy.
- **Personalization motivates sign-in:** All users expressed a willingness to log in or create an account if it meant receiving more relevant, personalized offers.

Key Takeaway: **Strike a balance between variety and clarity.** Users want choice, but not at the cost of cognitive effort. Streamlining presentation and offering personalization can enhance trust and reduce friction.

### Decisions Made

With the takeaways in mind, I moved forward with:
- **Users seek simplicity in evaluating value:** Given the US brands implicit nature for their offers, they got the best price and no promo codes are needed
- **Too many options = decision fatigue:** Hick’s Law highlights this and so I limited the cards in the drawer to 6 offers before users had to link out to all the offers. This reduced cognitive load for those that weren’t deal seekers and for those that were, they would do so at their disposal with moving forward with seeing all the offers.
- **Perceived abundance builds trust:** As the brands are the ones that are populating the Offer Hub they would prioritize variance of their offers. 
- **Personalization motivates sign-in:** While everyone was on board to bring this to life, due to constraints, we had to remove it from Phase 1 implementation.

### Additional Testing

In addition to user research, Signet conducts A/B testing as a standard part of validating new features. To assess the impact of a streamlined promotions experience, we tested the Offer Hub on our Kay brand for about a month. 

Performance Highlights:
- Average Order Value (AOV) increased by **+2.0%**
- Revenue per Visitor (RPV) increased by **+1.7%**

Based on these results, we were able to proceed with development.

## Working with Content

During the final stages of the development stage, the Dev Lead noted that it was taking a while for the offers to load. 

With this knowledge, I worked with the content design team and designed screens to provide feedback to our users.

## The Future of Offers

Give the constraints for this MVP, here are a few considerations for future enhancements:
- Personalization account holders
- Additional benefits for Loyalty members
- Additional button to ‘COPY’ a promo code – specific for our UK brands
- Color exploration for additional emphasis
- Combination experience with the Offer Page, that is currently owned by each Brand individually
    - This will allow brand partners to add offers in one experience for both experiences.
