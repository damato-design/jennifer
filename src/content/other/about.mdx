My design journey began with hands-on creativity and evolved into the digital space. Over time, I’ve learned that great design isn’t about finding the one “right” way—it’s about exploring ideas that spark joy and connection. My goal is to create simple, intuitive designs that make life easier and with accessibility in mind.

When I’m not immersed in design, you’ll find me practicing or teaching yoga, experimenting with new recipes, discovering local foodie spots, or gaming (currently obsessed with _Random Dice_). Let’s connect—I’d love to hear about your latest ideas or favorite restaurants!
