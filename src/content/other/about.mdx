title: Hi, I'm Jennifer
desc: I'm a design systems/product designer who tames chaos for a living, turning scattered ideas into scalable, accessible solutions... and making it look easy (most of the time).

My design journey began with hands-on creativity and evolved into the digital space. Over time, I’ve learned that great design isn’t about finding the one “right” way; it’s about exploring ideas that spark joy and connection. I aim to create simple, intuitive designs that make life easier, with accessibility in mind. I have strong opinions, loosely held, which allow for conversation and collaboration to thrive. 

When I’m not immersed in design, you’ll find me practicing or teaching yoga, experimenting with new recipes, discovering local foodie spots, or gaming (currently obsessed with _Random Dice_). Let’s connect—I’d love to hear about your latest ideas or favorite restaurants!
