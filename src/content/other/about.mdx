I started designing with my hands and then gravitated towards using digital tools. As I've grown, I've learned that design isn’t about having just one way to do something. It’s a way to try something different, that sparks delight and enthusiasm. For me, it’s about creating meaningful and positive experiences.

I’m constantly looking for opportunities to think, experiment, test, and tweak. I believe that simple is always better. The best designs and user experiences are the ones you don’t notice.

When I'm not in front of a computer, I'm immersing myself in nature, food, books, and Random Dice!
